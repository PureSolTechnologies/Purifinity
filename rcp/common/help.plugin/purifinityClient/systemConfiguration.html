	<h1>System Configuration</h1>
	<p>
		After the <a href="installation.html">installation</a> it is time to
		configure the system.
	</p>
	<p>Currently, there is not system configuration provided and
		required. Purifinity runs on default settings. System configuration
		might be added in future for the client itself. But, a system
		configuration is definitely needed and planned as soon as the
		Purifinity Server is provided and used for the setup of connection
		parameters.</p>
