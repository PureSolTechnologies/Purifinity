	<h1>Parts</h1>
	<p>Parts are called that way, because they are the parts of a
		perspective. Each perspective can contain multiple parts which are
		aligned site by site or stacked over each other in (almost) all
		combinations imaginable. Parts which are opened in a perspective can
		be open in another perspective, too.</p>
	<p>There are two types of parts which reside on a perspective next
		to each other:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="parts/views.html">Views</a></li>
		<li><a href="parts/editors.html">Editors</a></li>
	</ol>
