		analysis and evaluation system. The client is suitable to handle stand
		alone desktop installations as well as enterprise installations with a

		Therefore, software developers and users of Purifinity which are
		familiar with the Eclipse IDE are very familiar with the usage
		concepts within Purifinity Client. The general usage concepts sections
