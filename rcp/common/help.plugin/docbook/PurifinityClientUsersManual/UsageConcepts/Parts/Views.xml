		Views are parts of one or more <link linkend="Perspectives">Perspectives</link>
		(as well as <link linkend="Editors">Editors</link>). Views are used to
		present data which is not editable. Nevertheless, views might be very
		flexible components even they do not provide some editorial
		functionality. Additionally, views may have a state which is
		persistent when Purifinity Client is shutdown and loaded again during
		the next startup to provide the same setup again.
