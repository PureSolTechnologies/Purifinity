		Editors are the second type of
		<link linkend="Parts">part</link>
		next to
		<link linkend="Views">views</link>
		in a
		<link linkend="Perspectives">perspective</link>
		.
		Differently to views, editor may contain data which is editable by
		the user and needs to be saved afterwards. Editors have a 'changed'
		flag which leads to the typical question about whether the changes
		needed to be saved or not.
