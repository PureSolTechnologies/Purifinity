	<title>Purifinity's Analysis and Evaluation Architecture</title>
	<para>In this chapter an introduction is given on Purifinity's
		architecture for source code analysis and evaluation. The view on this
		architecture is from functional point of view which is most
		interesting for the user of Purifinity. A technical overview is given
		in a dedicated Administrator's Manual on how to setup and maintain
