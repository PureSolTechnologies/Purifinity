	<title>Metrics</title>
	<p>
		Metrics are calculated to evaluation a certain aspect of the source
		code or project. The result of a metric is a number with a possible
		unit which provides some basic information about the source which
		might be taken into consideration when quality is judged. Metrics do
		not give a hint for a special defect as <a href="defects.html">defect
			scanners</a> do. Metrics judge a certain part of the source code
		statistically.
