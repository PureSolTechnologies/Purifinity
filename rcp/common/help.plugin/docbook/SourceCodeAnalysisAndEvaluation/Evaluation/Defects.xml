	<p>
		As <a href="metrics.html">metrics</a> judge whole parts of the
		software for a certain aspect, defect scanners look for defect
		patterns. These patterns point to real problems in the code which need
		to be fix. Otherwise, these defects may lead into a wrong and not
		intended behavior of the product.
