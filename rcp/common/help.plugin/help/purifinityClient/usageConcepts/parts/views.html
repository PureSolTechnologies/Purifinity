	<h1>Views</h1>
	<p>
		Views are parts of one or more <a href="../perspectives.html">Perspectives</a>
		(as well as <a href="editors.html">Editors</a>). Views are used to
		present data which is not editable. Nevertheless, views might be very
		flexible components even they do not provide some editorial
		functionality. Additionally, views may have a state which is
		persisteded when Purifinity Client is shutdown and loaded again during
		the next startup to provide the same setup again.
