	<h1>Editors</h1>
	<p>
		Editors are the second type of <a href="../parts.html">part</a> next
		to <a href="views.html">views</a> in a <a href="../perspectives.html">perspective</a>.
		Differently to views, editor may contain data which is editable by the
		user and needs to be saved afterwards. Editors have a 'changed' flag
		which leads to the typical question about whether the changes needed
		to be saved or not.
