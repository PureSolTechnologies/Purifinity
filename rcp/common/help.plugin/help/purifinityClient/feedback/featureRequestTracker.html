	<p>A Feature Request Tracker is used by users and developers of a
		software product to request new functionality and to suggest
		improvements in the product. The features (as well as bugs) are
		reported in so-called tickets. Each ticket contains at least title and
		a description.</p>
	<p>
		The usage of the Feature Request Tracker is exactly the same as the <a
			href="bugTracker.html">Bug Tracker</a>. Only the type of the ticket
		needs to be set to 'Feature'. For more information, please have a look
		into the usage hints of the Bug Tracker.
