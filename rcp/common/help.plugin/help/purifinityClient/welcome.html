	<h1>Welcome to the Purifinity Client</h1>
	<p>The Purifinity Client is the application to access Purifinity's
		analysis and evaluation system. The client is suitable to handle stand
		alone desktop installations as well as enterprise installations with a
		central Purifinity Server.</p>
	<p>The client is based on the Eclipse RCP platform technology.
		Therefore, software developers and users of Purifinity which are
		familiar with the Eclipse IDE are very familiar with the usage
		concepts within Purifinity Client. The general usage concepts sections
		may be skipped in such a case. For all other user it is suggested to
		have a look into the basic usage sections to get an idea about the UI
		principles and not get overwhelmed of the very flexible client UI.</p>
