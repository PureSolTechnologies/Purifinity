		<h1>Features</h1>
		<h2>(Almost) Unlimited and Secure Storage</h2>
		<p>
			Purifinity's core feature is scalability. The most important part to
			reach this goal is a storage design which can grow on demand. To meet
			this target
			<ref url="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</ref>
			is used as basis for all storage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Source files are stored as is in Hadoop for reference, but to store
			metrics and other information a more structured database is needed.
			For this purpose
			<ref url="http://hbase.apache.org">HBase</ref>
			is used together with
			<ref url="http://phoenix.apache.org">Phoenix</ref>.
		</p>
		<p>This kind of storage has two major advantages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Linear scalability by adding more hardware with Hadoop and
				HBase as cluster.</li>
			<li>Due to automated replication no backup strategy is needed,
				because parts of the cluster can fail without loosing data.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Graph Storage</h2>
		<p>
			For analysis and evaluation purpose Graph Storage is needed which is
			also scalable. All graph data is put into a
			<ref url="http://ductiledb.com">DuctileDB</ref>
			which is also based on Hadoop/HBase and is scalable by design.
		</p>
		<h2>Powerful Server Architecture</h2>
		<p>
			Scalable storage is nice, but without the power to search and
			calculate meaningful information, it is useless. Based on
			<ref url="http://java-oracle.com">Java Technologies</ref>
			and
			<ref url="http://wildfly.org">WildFly</ref>
			a clustered application server can be used to scale together with the
			storage to handle a lot of large projects over a long period of time.
		</p>
		<h2>Universal Web User Interface</h2>
		<p>Due to a big diversity of hardware where Purifinity may be
			needed to run on (Desktop PCs, Laptops,Tables, Smartphones...) a web
			based, reactive user interface is needed.</p>
		<p>
			Purifinity's user interface is based on
			<ref url="https://angularjs.org">Angular</ref>
			and
			<ref url="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</ref>.
		</p>
		<h2>Plugin Architecture</h2>
		<p>Purifinity was meant to be language independent. To allow third
			parties to develop extensions, a plugin architecture is used.</p>
