		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>The name Purifinity is a combination of the words 'pure' or
			'puritiy' and 'infinity'.</p>
		<p>The goal is to create a source code analysis tool and platform
			to assure quality in the source code. For that purpose difference
			aspects need to be monitored:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Architecture</li>
			<li>Design</li>
			<li>Coding Style</li>
			<li>Defects</li>
			<li>Metrics</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Purifinity is meant to be a platform to collect and present all
			of these aspects in one single tool to help developers, quality
			assurance staff, testers and managers to track the software quality
			on source level.</p>
		<p>In times of polyglot programming, Purifinity needs to be
			language independent.</p>
		<p>Last, but not least, Purifinity is designed to handle a lot of
			large projects over a long time period.</p>
