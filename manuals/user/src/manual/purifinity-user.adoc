[[ManagingUsers]]
== Managing Users

=== Introduction

Users in Purifinity authenticate themself via their email address and a
password. Email addresses are use, because these are unique for every user
and they are also used to contact the users.

How to change the default mail domain for easier login, have a look into the
Installation Manual.

To manage users, you need to be logged into Purifinity as administrator. Have
a look into the Installation manual to find out, what the default accounts are
and what are there passwords. Use the default administrator account to login
for the first time to create your own administrator account. 

TIP: It is good practice to delete the default accounts, after the final
accounts are created. At least, the default passwords need to be changed for
the default accounts in order to increase security.

When logged in, change into the Administration section by clicking 'Administration' 
in the upper right corner. Select there 'Users' in the menu to get to the user
management section.

=== Adding Users

Select 'Users' tab and hit 'Add User...' button. Fill out the form and confirm
with 'OK'. 

=== Deleting Users 

Select 'Users' tab and search for the user to delete in users table. In Actions
column hit the 'Delete...' button in the row of the user to be deleted.

WARNING: Make sure you are on the correct account. There is no confirmation dialog
at the moment to double check for the correct intention.

=== Managing Roles

Currently, only three fixed roles are supported:

* Unprivileged User (read only)
* Engineer (no administration, but may start analyses)
* Administration (full access to all functionality)

The role management will be enhanced in future to provide fine grained access
to Purifinity's functionality.

== Managing Projects

In order to analyze source code and software projects, Purifinity needs to
know them and how to get the source.

When logged in, change into the Administration section by clicking 'Administration' 
in the upper right corner. Select there 'Projects' in the menu to get to the project
management section.

=== Create Projects

Use the button 'Create Project...' to add a new project to Purifinity. The appearing
form asks for all relevant information about the project:

* *Identifier:* is an identifier used in the database and for URLs. It must not contain
any special character or white spaces. It is best built by letters, numbers, minus and 
underscores.
* *Name:* is the name of the project as it is to be presented in reports and in the UI.
* *Description:* is an optional description for the project used in reports to summerize
what the project is about.
* *Repository Type:* is the type of repository where the source code can be read from. Depending on the selection the configuration is changed for the selected repository. 
*At the time of writing (Purifinity 0.4.0) only the 'Directory' repository type is implemented!*

=== Delete Projects

In 'Projects' section of Administrators page, a list of projects can be found. In the 
actions column a button can be found to delete the project. 

== Managing Plug-ins

Plug-ins are most important for the functionality of Purifinity. All important
functionality is brought to Purifinity via plug-ins. A lot of them need some
additional configuration or provide customization. In the next sub sections
it is explained how to enable and disable plug-ins and how to configure them.

For information about the different configuration options, have a look to the
documentation of the plug-ins.
 
=== Enable and Disable Plug-ins

When logged in, change into the Administration section by clicking 'Administration' 
in the upper right corner. Select there 'Settings' in the menu to get to the settings 
section. Select tab 'Plug-in Activation'.

There all deployed and initialized plug-ins can be found sorted by plug-in type. 
Plugin-ins are enabled and disabled by using the buttons on the right side. Red 'disabled√Ñ
buttons indicate that the specific plug-in is not enabled and cannot be used. A green 'enabled'
button indicates the activated plug-in which can be used.   

=== Configure Plug-ins 

When logged in, change into the Administration section by clicking 'Administration' 
in the upper right corner. Select there 'Settings' in the menu to get to the settings 
section. Select tab 'Plug-in Settings'.

There a tree can be found which sorts in root layer the types of the plug-ins and in the 
layers below the plug-ins itself and all there provided configuration parameters.

Tooltips over the values show what content is valid and expected.

side of the list the execute button can be found, to start a new analysis.

== Analyzes Results

On Purifinity's start page, the list of projects can be found. Click on the
project of interest to get to a list of analysis runs and there select the
run for which the results are to be shown.
