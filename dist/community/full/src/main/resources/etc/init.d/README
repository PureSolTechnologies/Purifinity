The provided scripts here were developed for Ubuntu >=14.04. The scripts are to
be copied into /etc/init.d. To enable them, the path for the Hadoop, HBase and
Purifinity installations need to be adapted. After that, insert the scripts 
into the boot process with: 

$ update-rc.d dfs defaults

To setup the password less dfs start, please do the following steps:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -P "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh//authorized_keys
