	<para>
		The goal of any Analysis can be described in a simple sentence:
		The
		Analysis takes a file and generates a Universal Syntax Tree. What
		a
		universal syntax tree is, is described in the
		<citetitle>Source Code Analysis and Evaluation</citetitle>
		manual.
	</para>
	<para>
		A more complex and more complete answer is, that an analysis
		generates an Universal Syntax Tree for files which are recognized as
		known and support which contains all information which are needed or
		valuable for a later evaluator.
