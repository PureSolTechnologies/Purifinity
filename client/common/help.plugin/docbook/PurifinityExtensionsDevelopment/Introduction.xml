	<para>Purifinity is the source code quality platform for developing
		high quality software. Due to each software project has different
		constraints, conventions and goals, the tools for supporting a wide
		range of projects need to be very flexible. The ultimate goal for such
		tools is to have an easy extensibility mechanism via plug-ins.
		Customers and users of the software are able to adapt the software to
		there own needs. A shelf software cannot provide all features which
		might be needed.
	</para>
	<para>
		To reach this goal of extensibility, Purifinity is based on OSGi
		and
		Eclipse plug-ins and on Java EE. These techniques make it easy to
		create fragments of functionality with a well defined, central API to
		extend Purifinity to almost all needs.

		In this manual the development of plug-ins is explained. It is
		explained how new languages and new types of files can be analyzed (
		<link linkend="AnalysisPlugins">Analysis Plug-ins</link>
		) and how new evaluations can be performed on these analyzes
		(

		).
