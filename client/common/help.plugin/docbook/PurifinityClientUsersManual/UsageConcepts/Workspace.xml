	<para>The workspace is a directory where information can be stored by
		Purifinity. These information are settings, current UI layouts and
		others which simplify the work with Purifinity for the user. During
		the first startup and if configured Purifinity asks for a workspace
		directory which is to be used. It is possible that way to organize the
		own work and to keep the focus on singular projects.

		<title>An Example Usage Scenario</title>
		<para>As a quality manager it is possibly needed to keep an eye on the
			source code quality of multiple projects which is also contains
			multiple modules or libraries. In this case it is possible to keep a
			single workspace for each of the different software projects. The
			different modules or libraries are organized than into different
			analysis projects.
		</para>
		<para>
			Depending on the current focus, the workspace can be selected with
			the
			<link linkend="SelectWorkspace">Switch Workspace</link>
			functionality.
			Additionally, it is also possible to run multiple
			instances of
			Purifinity on different workspaces.
		</para>
	</section>
	<section>
		<title>Limitation</title>
		<para>It is not possible to run multiple instances of Purifinity on a
			single workspace. It is also not really meaningful. During startup
			Purifinity will complain as soon as another instance locks the
			selected workspace.
